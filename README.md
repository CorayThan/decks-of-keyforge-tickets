## SAS Change request guidelines

1. **Do No Harm** It is more important to prevent falsely overrated decks and cards than to accurately capture all value. Your idea should improve scores for almost all decks it touches, and very rarely cause a card to be overrated in value in decks.
2. **Legacy Cards are lower priority** If a card has not be included in the last two sets, it is considered a "legacy" card in terms of changes to SAS. Changes to legacy cards will only be considered if it is obviously inconsistent with other cards with similar scores, or there is an egregious problem.
3. **Avoid suggesting minor tweaks to scores** Make sure your change request is relevant. If you think a card is only off by 0.25 AERC most of the time, it probably isn't worth updating.
4. **Read the [About Page](https://decksofkeyforge.com/about/sas)** This page details the basic details of how decks and cards are scored in SAS.
5. **Read the AERC Rating guidelines** Find the relevant sections in the [AERC rating guidelines](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WkphfSzWj-hZ8l7BMhAgNF6-8b3Qj9cFiV7gGkR9HBU/edit?usp=sharing) This google doc contains detailed information about how cards are rated, and what expectations and rules are used to maintain consistency.
6. **Compare with existing cards** using the [card search tool](https://decksofkeyforge.com/cards) to ensure your change request is consistent with existing cards.
7. **Don't make duplicates** Search the [card change issues](https://github.com/CorayThan/decks-of-keyforge-tickets/issues?q=label%3Asas-change-for-card+) or [sas feature change issues](https://github.com/CorayThan/decks-of-keyforge-tickets/issues?q=label%3Asas-feature+) to make sure your request isn't a duplicate or hasn't already been rejected
